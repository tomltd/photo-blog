				<h2 id="colorado">Colorado 2016</h2>
				<h3>22st June</h3>

				<p>Woke up at 5:30 this morning and could sleep no more so we got up and had a bit of breakfast and headed out downtown.
					Wandering about the Capitol building it was very quiet apart from a few squirrels and the odd homeless person.</p>
				<p>No where was open so we went for a coffee and a wizz to kill some time until the Colorado History Museum opened at 10.
					There was an interesting exhibit about mining in the Rockies with a fake lift and BLASTING game.</p>
				<p>Took the free bus up 16th and hit Biker Jims Gourmet Hot Dogs. Sampled some dogs and craft beer then went for a second beer
					at the Falling Rock Tap House.</p>
				<p>Wandered up to Union Station and went for another wizz then dunked our feet in the river at confluence park. I may live to regret
					that as the water was pretty trashy.</p>
				<p>Had a quick look around REI then got the bus back and walked back to the apartment for burritos and salad</p>

				<h3>23rd June</h3>

				<p>I woke up at a resonable 7:00 this morning. We had a bit of breakfast and headed out. Made a quick stop at the Colfax Pot Shop
					and then pushed on to City Park and the Denver Zoo. Crazy hot again today, about 35 degrees by 10:00.</p>
				<p>The zooniverse was great and really big but still gave off the vibe of animal prison a bit. Still a lot of the animals wouldn't
					exist if it wasn't for the zoo. After 4 hours we had enough and went back down to Colfax for a lunch at Anne's dinner.</p>
				<p>After cooling off at the dinner we went down to the Botanic gardens which was having a free day and half of Denver seemed to taking
					advantage of it. A storm started to roll in so we headed back to the apartment after our nightly stop at natural grocers</p>

				<h3>24th June</h3>

				<p>Found out about the EU vote on waking. Sad Times. Went to Jelly for breakfast and Kitty found out what an American Biscuit is.
					Next we drove the rental car to the Outback Tackle shop and found the man in the shop had gone to UEA when he was in School.
					Then a quick stop in Best Buy and on to Walmart where we bought a tent and had a sandwich. Next stop home to meet Marina then
					off back into town to visit the Denver Art Museum which was really good. Lots of artifacts, ancient masks (I want you to be brave).
				</p>
				<p>Walked a couple miles down the block to The Buckhorn Exchange, Denvers oldest resturant for Denvers most expensive steak.
				We both had Bison steaks which were super.</p>

				<h3>25th June</h3>
				<p>Drove to Boulder and had a mooch about and made a pilgrimadge to the Croc shop. Boulder was really nice, as it was a Saturday
					there was lots happening on the main drag, Belly Dancing, Swing Dancing, tubing down the river. We had a bit of lunch in the park.
					Kitty bought her first climbing shoes	and then drove up to Ceran St Vrain wilderness area to do some wild camping.</p>
				<p>Ceran St Vrain was amazing, there was a river and you could camp where you like. We found a beautiful spot and collected a couple of massive
					logs which Kitty Sawed to make a Kissing log fire which lasted all night. Then we had a few local beers and slept soundly to the babbling river.</p>

				<h3>26th June</h3>
				<p>Woke up at 8:30 and packed up the camp. I was sad to leave but we had to make a move. Onward to Rocky Mountain National Park. As it was a Sunday
					the park was very busy and we couldn't do our first choice of walk so instead atempted a walk to Yipson Lake. Turns out this was no small walk and combined
					with our altitude sickness we didn't quite make it. However we still make it to the highest point and did a mean river crossing. We had to walk over a fallen log
					with spectators and both ended up shaking in our boots on the otherside. On the way back we ran into Aaron Rolston of 127 Hours fame who was taking his kid out.</p>
				<p>We drove down to the Aspenglen campsite just inside the park gates and set up our camp. Avoided the talk on coyotes and made friends
					with a couple of deer that were eating around our tent.</p>


				<h3>27th June</h3>
				<p>After packing up our tent we drove the Trail Ridge Road and did a small mile hike up at 13,000 feet. Saw a family of American Elk and felt weird from the altitude.</p>
				<p>We stopped at Grand Lake and walked along the Deadwood style main street, then on to Granby for burgers and fries.</p>
				<p>Arrived at the May Queen camp site about 6 and felt like it was a little isolated but in a good way. Had a little fire and some food and did a wash in the river.</p>

				<h3>28th June</h3>
				<p>Up at 5 after a terrible cold night. There was ice on the car and we set off for Mount Elbert. The highest 14er. Arrived feeling nervous and had to walked and extra 2 miles
					up to the trail head as we didn't have a 4x4. It was a nice walk though through some Aspen forest.</p>
				<p>The hike was long and hard. 12 miles total with 4,000 gain in elevation. The air was thin and I couldn't really talk much. The scenery
						was spectacular. There was a trail runner who did the route twice in the time it took us. We explained it was because we live at sea level.
						There was also a man in a crocodile onesie.</p>
				<p>Made it back to the car and drove back to May Queen for a quick dip in the lake and some food and a fire. Lots of mosquitos</p>


				<h3>29th June</h3>
				<p>Having decided not to hike to conundrum hot springs, we drove to Aspen and camped at Difficult campsite. I drove one wheel of the car off a bridge into our campsite
					but with some pushing we managed to right it again. Set up camp and drove into Aspen. We did a bit of exploring around Aspen then walked a bit of the hunter creek trail.</p>
					<p>Saw a lot of clone people who had too much botox and self watering grass on the sidewalk... Went back to the camp which was one of my favs as it had it's own stream.</p>

				<h3>30th June</h3>
				<p>Packed up the camp and headed to Montrose for a clean up at the Black Canyon Hotel. It was a long drive, and the scenery changed from mountains to desert.</p>
				<p>Had multiple showers and cleaned our stinky clothes at the motel then walked a mile down the main drag to Colorado Boy Pizza and Brewery for some amazing pizza. We sat
					at the bar by the oven and watched them making pizzas, learned the secret technique for dough rolling and drank some lovely beers.</p>
				<p>Went back to the motel for the worst sleep ever in a boilng room and missed the ourdoors!</p>

				<h3>1st July</h3>
				<p>Enjoyed a complimentary breakfast of toast and waffles then hit the road to Ouray. Arrived at the Amphitheater Camp Site minutes after the last site was full.
					Luckily you can camp anywhere in a national forest so went back up the road and found a spot on the portland mine road, which is a 4x4 access road. Great views
					looking over Ouray. It started to rain so we went back into town for an amazing breakfast at Roast and Toast and met an American from Sherringham who used to live
					in Norwich. Second person we've met who's lived in Norwich. Drove the crazy mountain road to Silverton and went to the massive museum which had a mine in it.</p>
					<p>Went back to Ouray and went to see the Box Canyon falls which became a regular haunt as they have flush toilets.</p>
					<p>Back to the camp for some food and a small hard to start fire.</p>

				<h3>2nd July</h3>
				<p>Still raining so pootled about a bit and visited the cascade falls which were pretty huge, then went to the Ouray brewery which was a total tourist trap
					and then on to the Ouray House Brewery which was a lot more authentic.</p>
				<p>Back up to the campsite where there were lots of fireworks going off, this is when we met Dustin. Dustin was from Colorado Springs and was drinking Moonshine and setting
					off fireworks. He'd lost his car keys and his Jeep alarm was going off over and over again. We talked to him for quite a while but couldn't find his keys so left him to it.
					Had some dinner listening to Dustins alarm then he found his keys and started letting of more fireworks and as the sun went down began yelling at no one for quite a while</p>

					<h3>3rd July</h3>
					<p>Up early for a long drive, went to Box Canyon for breakfast and then drove to Gunnison, St Elmo ghost town (full of ATV riders) and South Park. Eventually ended up in Idaho Springs for showers and clean clothes</p>
					<p>I think we ate some food at home and went to sleep.</p>

					<h3>4th July</h3>
					<p>Went to the 4th parade at Georgetown, a woman cried during the anthem and there was a beer and pizza float. Then back to Idaho Springs for some music. We walked up and down the town and saw a good bluegrass band
						then went to the tommyknocker brewery for a few beers and then down to the Smokin Yard BBQ resturant. It then rained a lot a lot and we walked home and watched the firework from the atic window. They went on and on and on</p>

					<h3>5th July</h3>
					<p>Quick Scuttle up St Marys glacier which is actually a snow field then back to the house for a rest afternoon before going to Red Rocks Amphitheatre to see Flight of the Conchords. It was rad. </p>

					<h3>6th July</h3>
					<p>Packed up and climbed Mt Evans from Summit Lake, it was only a short one but still good. Saw some mountain sheep, goats, hamsters, marmots etc.</p>
					<p>Found the Bison herd containing genuine yosemite Bison which are the pure breeds. Amazing I really enjoyed seeing them</p>
					<p>Drove to Boulder to find our last stay and it's great but no couch and everywhere stinks of weed. lol </p>
					<p>Walked to the sink a cool student resturant that seems like it could easily be in Manchester, had the local beers and some mega pizza!
						Saw lots of frat houses and student digs, one had a slackline over a creek which was pretty cool.</p>

					<h3>7th July</h3>
					<p>Today is erand day, firstly had some breakfast on the deck then packed up the car with stuff for the thift store. Drove across town to a thrift store
						and donated our tent and chairs and some shoes, then drove to a petrol station to hoover out the whip and put it through the car wash.</p>
					<p>Spent the afternoon by Boulder Creek and walked up and down Pearl street, which really came alive in the evening</p>

					<h3>8 July</h3>
					<p>Packed up and dumped our trash in the neighbours bins, drove into Denver and parked up the car. Went for a walk and went to a bar/resturant called
						Prohibition. Ordered a burger and we think they brought us a MacDonalds so I complained and we got a cheap meal.</p>
					<p>Got an Uber to the airport and our driver was really interesting, he had come from Ethiopia and was working towards citizenship</p>
					<p>At the airport really early but just hung out</p>
					<p>Plane....Home. The End</p>
