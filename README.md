# ri-project 

A quick demo blog featuring srcset images for different resolutions including a x2 high res set for retina type displays. Also includes cropped images at smaller page widths to demonstrate art direction.

The header includes an SVG file which can be easily manipulated for different media types. I have used icon fonts and css icons to minimise the total size of the site for devices on restricted bandwidths.

I have also included a small JQuery script to add smooth scrolling to jump between anchors.
